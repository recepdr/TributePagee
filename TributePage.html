                <h4>Knowledge By Donkey’s Back</h4>
                <p>It’s 1944. World War II is about to end. Young Mustafa from Ürgüp is back home from military service. His mother marries him off in a rush so that he stays in Ürgüp. </p>
                <p>Mustafa Güzelgöz finds a job which partly results from his passion for football. In return for training the local football team, he is assigned as a librarian for a pay of 40 Turkish liras.</p>

                <h4>How does a chair change someone’s life?</h4>
                <p>Mustafa Güzelgöz finishes the classification at the library and is waiting for booklovers. There aren’t many visitors. At that time, he goes to an opening in the village. There are chairs reserved for all the high officials only except for Mustafa Bey.</p>
                <p><i>“Veterinarian, health officer or a doctor… They all do some service for the citizens. But what do I do?”</i> thinks Mustafa Güzelgöz and decides to open libraries to replace the common houses in the villages. While he conducts these conversations, he also asks for books by writing letters to all the people from Ürgüp scattered around Turkey.</p>

                  <p>“The people who came to my father’s library were all men. There were never any women. My father was obsessed with this. He couldn’t find a way to make women read books. For many nights, he thought about this. One morning, he screamed with joy. He found a way. He immediately sat down and wrote a letter to sewing machine manufacturers. They took my father really seriously. Two sewing machines arrived. Announcements were made. Ladies formed a line to be able to use those two sewing machines. And as they were waiting, they started reading books.”
